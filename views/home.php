                <p>this website aims to provide advanced filters that
                   the osu! website doesn't have, such as <strong>playlists</strong>
                   and a more exhaustive <strong>filter by tags</strong>.</p>
                <p>this isn't meant to replace the osu!'s beatmap
                   search system, but more to build something that
                   meets specific needs.</p>
                <p>how about checking out our playlists? with an
                   account, you can make your own too!</p>
                <strong><p>note: this website is NOT affiliated with osu! and
                   is a fan-made project.</p></strong>
